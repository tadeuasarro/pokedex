# React & Redux Capstone

#### Hello there! Welcome to my Kanto National Pok√©dex. For this project, I have created a React & Redux app that consumes data from [this awesome API](https://pokeapi.co/), in order to recreate the Kanto region Pok√©dex from the Pok√©mon series. The user can check information about all 151 Pok√©mon from the first season of the anime!

#### Features
- Index the original 151 Pok√©mon
- Filter the Pok√©mon by their types
- Check detailed information about each Pok√©mon
